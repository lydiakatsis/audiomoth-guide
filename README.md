The [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/) is a low-cost acoustic recorder designed for wildlife and conservation applications. This practical guide is a repository for all of the tips, tricks, and procedures we, the [Kitzes Lab](http://www.kitzeslab.org/), developed in the process of deploying hundreds of AudioMoths since March 2018.


## Quick start

AudioMoths are very easy to set up out of the box. For instance:

* Purchase necessary supplies, including batteries and SD cards
* [Download](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/applications) the timesetter/programming app 
* Create a program; this is explained with graphics on the [AudioMoth Config App tutorial](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/config-app-guide), and in detail in our [guide](https://github.com/rhine3/audiomoth-guide/blob/master/guide.md).
* Insert batteries and SD cards into AudioMoth
* Connect AudioMoth to computer and press green button on configuration app
* Create housings for your AudioMoths
* Devise a field protocol for deployment of the AudioMoths
* Deploy AudioMoths and put up any legally required "recording in progress" signs
